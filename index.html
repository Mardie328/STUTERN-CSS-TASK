            <p>My name is Taofeek Mardiyyah.</p>
            <p>Technology is a passion of mine and I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs.
                I want to use my skills and knowledge to make other people's jobs easier and more productive. I believe IT support technicians are important team members for any organization because they combine technical knowledge with interpersonal skills.

            <p>So far, I've learnt about CSS cascade hierarchy and a lot of CSS properties.</p>
            <p>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. 
                In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

                The difference between margin, padding and border is that margin is how much space is around an object, padding is how much space is within an object sides and itâ€™s contents while
                border is between the margin and padding of an object.
